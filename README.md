# Flipbook

Flipbook is an app that lets the user create animations in the style of a flipbook. The user draws a frame of their animation, then see that frame as a watermark on the next frame to help with the accuracy of the drawing.

## Inspiration
My dad. This is literally his idea, I just implemented it. And it’s probably one of the best apps I’ve started to write!

## To Do
* Move the playback controls to the playback drawer.
* Make the drawer buttons a little less intrusive.
* Add a control for the playback speed.
* Add export functionality.
* Investigate line smoothing.
